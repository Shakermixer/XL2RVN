## A collection of Ideas to bring Xen to the Ravencoin Chain

### How could Xen, XenNFT and DBXen and Fenix be used on the Ravencoin blockchain? 
This question is the motivation of this repo.

The README is the primary container for text to collect, to describe concepts, which are needed, useful or help.
Feel free to contribute.

Yeeehaw.
### Definitions,entities & terminology:

#### Layer 1 
refers to a base network, such as Bitcoin, BNB Chain, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure. Layer-1 blockchains can validate and finalize transactions without the need for another network. Making improvements to the scalability of layer-1 networks is difficult, as weâ€™ve seen with Bitcoin. As a solution, developers create layer-2 protocols that rely on the layer-1 network for security and consensus. Bitcoin's Lightning Network is one example of a layer-2 protocol. It allows users to make transactions freely before recording them into the main chain.

#### layer 2 
refers to any off-chain network, system, or technology built on top of a blockchain (commonly known as a layer-1 network) that helps extend the capabilities of the underlying base layer network. Layer-2 networks can support any blockchain to introduce enhancements such as higher transaction throughputs. In regards of this repo, the main motivation is to achieve a special evm functionality, which enables the use of the Xen Cryptocurrency and it's derivatives. The Ravencoin Chain is very fast and not expensive at all.
